# R-psychsci2017
Example R and MATLAB code from Carr, Brady, &amp; Winkielman (Psych Science 2017):

Here's some code to do similar psychometric analyses as those presented in Experiments 1-2 in Carr, Brady, & Winkielman (Psych Science 2017).  The paper can be accessed here:  https://evanwalkercarr.weebly.com/uploads/3/2/3/1/32319711/carr_et_al._-_2017_-_are_you_smiling_or_have_i_seen_you_before.pdf

Both of the main R scripts ("ps2017_exp1.R" and "ps2017_exp2.R") involve cleaning NA values and outliers, fitting psychometric functions, and plotting the results (similar to Figures 3 and 6 in the paper).  These scripts are revised/adapted to (hopefully) make it easier for other people to do similar analyses.

The MATLAB script ("ps2017_exp2_sbjLevelFits.m") is code for the method we used to get subject-level estimates for thresholds (alpha parameters) and slopes (beta parameters) in Exp. 2.  Note that the script requires the Palamedes toolbox to be installed (http://www.palamedestoolbox.org).
